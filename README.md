# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Project Overview

StudyNest is a student-centered web platform designed to simplify access to academic course materials and enhance the learning experience through personalized, intelligent features. Built to address common learning challenges faced by students in higher education, StudyNest offers a clean, responsive interface that delivers curated academic resources and tailored course recommendations.

At its core, StudyNest is built around three key features:

1. Smart Learning Dashboard  
Students can get a holistic overview of all their enrolled courses in one place. The dashboard presents relevant learning materials, progress summaries, and AI-driven content suggestions. This smart interface helps students prioritize tasks, track progress, and discover additional resources that align with their academic goals.

2. Downloadable Modules  
One of the major benefits of StudyNest is the ability to download modules and access them offline. This ensures that learning is not limited by internet availability, which is particularly valuable for students in low-connectivity regions or those who prefer to study offline.

3. Personalized Learning Paths  
Using AI algorithms, StudyNest analyzes a studentâ€™s learning behavior and academic interests to recommend customized content paths. This means students are guided toward modules that are most relevant to their progress, goals, and performance history. It not only saves time but enhances engagement and academic achievement.

The application was built using modern web technologies (React.js for the frontend and Node.js for backend services) and is optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

## Accessibility Considerations

StudyNest is committed to creating an inclusive learning environment. As part of our accessibility audit, the platform currently scores 76% in accessibility, meaning that the majority of elements have no detected violations or items requiring review. While this is a positive start, accessibility is an ongoing commitment, and continuous improvements are planned.

Current accessibility features include:

- Keyboard Navigation: All primary interactions are fully keyboard accessible.
- Semantic HTML: Proper use of tags helps ensure compatibility with screen readers.
- Responsive Design: The interface adapts to various screen sizes and devices to support learners using assistive technologies.
- Alt Text & ARIA Labels: Key elements are labeled for screen reader clarity, improving navigation for visually impaired users.

Future updates will target a 100% accessibility score with more comprehensive ARIA integration, motion control preferences, and user-controlled display options.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical design is a foundational principle of StudyNest. From data privacy to inclusive design, the platform is built to respect and support users without manipulation or exploitation.

- Data Privacy: Minimal user data is collected, and all personal information is securely encrypted. Students have full control over their data and can export or delete it at any time.
- No Dark Patterns: The user experience is designed to be transparent and user-friendly, without deceptive UI practices.
- Fair Access: By offering downloadable modules and lightweight design, the platform ensures usability in bandwidth-constrained environments.
